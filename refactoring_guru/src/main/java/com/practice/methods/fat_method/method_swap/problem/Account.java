/**
 * Here we have many fields and few of them even changing own values during calculation,
 * so it is hard to understand what is going on and even make some changes.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Solution is to move core functionality that calculates gamma in this case to separate class.
 * make fields as class level fields and extract one method to few more readable and flexible methods.
 * The Code example is from refactoring guru course.
